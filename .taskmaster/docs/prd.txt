# Static Asset Loading Issue Analysis

## Project Overview

We need to diagnose and fix a persistent issue with static assets (specifically logo files) not loading in a rebranded Dockerized application. The application was previously named "Khoj" and is being rebranded to "Aletheia". Despite multiple fixes, the logo files are still returning 404 errors.

## Current Status

1. We have updated the `src/interface/web/app/components/logo/khojLogo.tsx` file to use the correct paths with `/static/` prefix.
2. We created a new `aletheia.webmanifest` file from the existing `khoj.webmanifest`.
3. We updated all references to the webmanifest file in HTML files and Android configuration.
4. We built and deployed a Docker image with these changes.
5. The logos are still not displaying, with 404 errors in the server logs:
   - `GET /Aletheia_logo_text.svg HTTP/1.1` 404
   - `GET /static/aletheia.webmanifest HTTP/1.1` 404
   - `GET /Aletheia_logo.svg HTTP/1.1` 404

## Requirements

1. Diagnose why static assets aren't being served correctly despite our fixes.
2. Check if static files are being collected properly during Docker build.
3. Verify file locations and permissions in the running container.
4. Identify any remaining frontend code references to incorrect paths.
5. Fix the issue so that logo files load correctly.

## Constraints

1. This is a Django/FastAPI backend with Next.js frontend.
2. The frontend is built and then served by Django.
3. Static files should be served from the `/static/` path.
4. Changes must be compatible with Docker deployment.
5. The Docker build process includes a `collectstatic` step.

## Success Criteria

1. Logo files load correctly in the application.
2. No 404 errors for static assets in server logs.
3. Changes are minimal and focused on the specific issue.
4. Solution is documented for future reference.
